## Course Description

This course will consider the influential role of design in film, photography and new media from a historical and theoretical perspective. The specific content of the course may vary according to the context and the particular focus of the curriculum in any given year. Practical workshops may be offered if appropriate to the material being presented. 

_Lecture: 3 hours_

## Course Objectives

To acquaint students with design methods as it may relate to their field of practice within Photography, New Media or Film. Students taking this course should adopt a self-motivated approach to their work. 

In an effort to cater to the specific needs of the class, a special Q&A has been scheduled for week 11. Please submit your questions for that week via this [form](http://goo.gl/forms/nGt7UhyZlO).

## Course Text:

No textbook is required, but a dedicated sketchbook is highly recommended. Students are encouraged to attempt [sketch notes](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321857897/samplepages/0321857895.pdf) for lectures.

Additional sources of information, text and websites will be recommended throughout the term.

## Course Survey

A course survey will be conducted at the end of term during the 10th, 11th or 12th week of the term. Please ensure this survey completed before the end of the term.

## Course Conduct

In an effort to create a professional atmosphere, students are requested to arrive to class on time, avoid coming in and out, and are required to silence all electronic devices while class is in session.

Students are encouraged to take notes during the lectures. Students who want to use their laptops to do so, are asked to take a place in the rows behind the students who take notes by hand.

## Communication

### Office Hours

My office is IMA362, and I will be available an hour before class as well as immediately after class. 

### Email

I can be reached at [ryan.price@ryerson.ca](mailto:ryan.price@ryerson.ca).

Ryerson e-mail accounts are to be maintained by all students. All official e-mail communication with professors should take place using this account see [http://www.ryerson.ca/ acadcouncil/current/pol157.pdf](http://www.ryerson.ca/ acadcouncil/current/pol157.pdf). Email response will be 
no more than 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on weekends. 

### Blackboard

Course materials will be available online. It is your responsibility to check for periodic announcements, deadlines, and general course information.

## Assignments

All assignments are to be completed for the start of class on the date assigned. Specifics for each assignment will be provided as the term progresses.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected and required. Students are responsible for making their own accommodation for missed classes. (Any additional material will be available on blackboard but the instructor will not review or summarize lectures, provide notes,
or arrange screenings.) 

Late arrivals are disruptive to the class and students are asked to wait for an appropriate break before entering. If a student has to leave early for any reason, please inform/consult the instructor prior to the start of class.

The School of Image Arts policy states that three (3) unexcused absences will result in a drop in one letter grade. More than three absences may be cause for failure of the course.

To avoid academic penalty, medical certificates are required for absences and late assignments,see [www.ryersib.ca/rr/medical.pdf](www.ryersib.ca/rr/medical.pdf) for the certificate. Requests for Religious Observances must be made formally within the first two weeks of class (see [http://www.ryerson.ca/acadcouncil/current/pol150.pdf](http://www.ryerson.ca/acadcouncil/current/pol150.pdf). 

## Participation

Participation grades are incorporated in all of your work and are defined by your attendance and involvement in class during peer presentation and class discussions. 

## Accommodations

### Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability that requires accommodation, please make sure you register with the Access Centre and supply any necessary Accommodation Forms [http://www.ryerson.ca/accesscentre/](http://www.ryerson.ca/accesscentre/). Accommodations can not be applied retroactively. 

### Accommodation of Student Religious Observance

Given that timely requests will prevent difficulties with arranging constructive accommodations, students are strongly encouraged to notify instructors of an observance accommodation within the first two weeks of classes. Any religious observance obligations that will lead to absences from campus or academic activities during the semester should be dealt with using the appropriate forms. For more information see: [http://www.ryerson.ca/equity/calendar/](http://www.ryerson.ca/equity/calendar/)

### Other requests for Academic Consideration

Other requests for Academic Consideration which are not related to medical or religious observation must be submitted in writing together with the Academic Consideration form to the student’s program office. The letter must clearly state the reasons for the request and describe the events or circumstances that seriously impair the student’s ability to meet their academic obligations, and that were beyond the student’s control. When possible, supporting documentation must be attached to the letter. The office will notify the instructor when they have received the request. See: [http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/senate/forms/academic_consideration_document_submission.pdf](http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/senate/forms/academic_consideration_document_submission.pdf)

Submission of the Academic Consideration form and all supporting documentation to your program office does not relieve you of the responsibility to **notify your instructor** of the problem as soon as it arises, and to contact with the instructor again after the documents have been submitted in order to make the appropriate arrangements.

If you do not have a justifiable reason for an absence and/or have not followed the procedure described above, you will not be given credit or marks for the work missed during that absence.

For more detailed information on these issues, please refer to Senate Policy 134 at (Undergraduate Academic Consideration and Appeals) and Senate Policy 150 (Accommodation of Student Religious Observance Obligations). Both can be found at [www.ryerson.ca/senate/policies/](www.ryerson.ca/senate/policies/)

## Evaluation

### Attendance 

Each student will be allowed two missed classes per term; three will affect their grades. Please note it is possible to fail the term as a result of low attendance. 

### Grades

**Assignments are due on the day specified.** Semi-completed projects will be accepted on the day specified, meaning it is better to show up with something incomplete rather than nothing at all. 
 
There are three assignments over the course of the term, totalling 100%. The assignments are as follows:

- Design essay 40%
- Creative assignment 40%
- Presentation 20%

All assignments will be graded on a ten-point scale:

**10** 95%-100%, superb 

**9** 84%-94%, excellent 

**8** 73%-83%, above average work, student understood problem assigned and successfully answered project, but not fully resolved 

**7** 61%-73%, average work; project submitted needs to be more completely articulated, student lacks some understanding in some areas. 

**6-5** 50%-60%, some problems have been noted, solution indicates a lack of understanding and insufficient level of execution. 

**4-0**, fail, work of solutions inappropriate; does not meet criteria assigned; level of work poor; lack of work; not enough effort put into project.

Marking criteria includes:

- concept development / roughs and comprehensives (as required)
- presentation & craftsmanship
- execution & understanding
- analysis
- spelling and grammar

### Academic Integrity

Please familiarize yourself with the Ryerson Code of Conduct as it pertains to academic integrity. Consequences of violating the code are serious and are not a matter left to the individual faculty member’s discretion.

Assignments will _not_ be submitted to a plagiarism detection service automatically, but will be assessed on a case‐by‐case basis and, where deemed necessary, suspicious work will be
fully investigated.
