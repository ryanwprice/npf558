## Assignment 1: Presentation

The first assignment will be group presentations on a selected designer. This assignment is an opportunity to learn from a specific leader in the design industry. Groups will consist of <strike>two</strike> three students, giving a 20 minute presentation which includes a 15-minute talk (divided equally between presenters), followed by 5 minutes for questions from the class. Appropriate visuals should be used (PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, etc.) and each student is required to provide a printed one-page brief outlining their respective content. The presentations will focus on the design work of the individual(s), but should also include discussion of their other artistic interests (if applicable) as well as a brief biographical history.

Presentations will occur over the course of the term, as per the dates selected during sign-up. Attendance for all presentations is mandatory. 

A sign-up sheet will be available on week 2 to book your presentation time.

## Assignment 2 - What is Design?

### Print

You will be expected to produce a tabloid-sized poster (11x17) which answers the question “what is design?”. The aesthetic is completely up to you, but it should reflect your answer to the question and thoughtfully consider the design principles discussed over the course of the term. The poster text should not exceed 500 words. Wherever possible, images should be your own, and at the very least, given proper attribution.

Provide a high-resolution copy of your poster as a PDF. Include with the poster a 'manifesto': your 500 words printed, double spaced. Your poster should be burned to disc or on a USB drive (which will be returned after the break week).

The assignment is due at the start of the last class before reading week. 

or 

### Video

You will be expected to produce a video which answers the question “what is design?”. The video should not be more than 1 minute and no less that 30 seconds. A narration of some kind should be included to aide in answering the question. The script should not exceed 500 words. The aesthetic is completely up to you, but it should reflect your answer to the question and thoughtfully consider the design principles discussed over the course of the term. Wherever possible, imagery should be your own, and at the very least, given proper attribution.

Please submit your video on a burned disc or USB drive (which will be returned after the break week). Include with the video a 'manifesto'; your 500 words printed, double spaced.

The assignment is due at the start of the last class before reading week

_Note: If you feel you do not have the technical skills necessary for this assignment, please come see me well in advance of the deadline so we can work out an agreeable alternative to the poster/video component._


## Assignment 3 - Design Essay

You will be expected to produce a 1000–1200 word essay that will explore an aspect of design covered over the course of the term and expand on the ideas discussed in class. You can discuss the topic as it relates to your own area of practice, or simply as a thought or idea of particular interest to you. 

The essays will be curated and presented as an online magazine and e-book. Options for a physical copy will be discussed and decided by the class.

The assignment is due at the start of the last class of the term.

Essays will be submitted in person as a print copy as well as submitted electronically.

### Formatting

To facilitate easy conversion for the online magazine and e-book (and print edition?), you will be asked to write your essay using a specific coding language, _Markdown_. This may seem like a difficult hurdle, but the language is very straighforward and there is a [syntax guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) available to help you out. Basically, as long as you are only writing straigh paragraphs, there is nothing you need to know. 

There are several editors which may also prove useful, but any text editor will suffice, as long as the file extension is _md_.

### Markdown editors:

- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/) — My personal favourite, but it also costs money
- [Dillenger](http://dillinger.io/) — Free, web-based
- [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) — Free & Paid, Windows
- [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) — Free, Mac
- [Texts](http://www.texts.io/) — Free, Mac & Windows
- [35+ Markdown apps for Mac](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/35-markdown-apps-for-the-mac/) — Many, many, more!

### Metadata

You are also required to include a set of metadata about your file. This is included at the start of your md file and should look like the example below:

	---
	title: Why Comic Sans is Great
	lname: Price
	fname: Ryan
	email: ryan.price@ryerson.ca
	web: ryerson.ryanprice.net
	license: BY-SA
	image-description: A boat sailing in the sea
	bio: Lorem ipsum dolor sit... 
	---

You can download the [sample.md.zip](/assets/sample.md.zip) file or copy & paste the text (including the dashes) above to get you started.

### License

All articles will maintain their own rights. It is up to you whether you apply a full copyright to the article or provide other privileges via a Creative Commons license. To help assist you in deciding which license you wish to use, the Creative Commons has built a [license picker](http://creativecommons.org/choose/).

Below are the codes you would apply to your file in the metadata section noted above:

- **BY** — Attribution
- **BY-SA** — Attribution-ShareAlike
- **BY-ND** — Attribution-NoDerivs
- **BY-NC** - Attribution-NonCommercial
- **BY-NC-SA** — Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
- **BY-NC-ND** — Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs

_If you choose to apply full copyright, you can simply leave the license blank in the metadata._

### Images

What would a design publication be without images? Along with your essay, please include two images: a headshot, and an image to accompany the text.

The headshot is for your author bio and should be cropped to 400x400px and saved as an RGB jpg. The filename should be all lowercase and written as `lastname-firstname-headshot.jpg`.

Your main image can be whatever you want, but should help enhance the message of your essay in some way. Please do not put any text in the image, as it may be cropped during production. The final image must be 1500x850px and saved as a jpeg. The filename should be all lowercase and written as `lastname-firstname.jpg`. The image will not be considered in the final grade (unless it is absent), so you are free to use any rights-free image. Please ensure you give proper credit for the image, by including it as part of the image description (see above).

### Citations

If you reference any books, Web sites, magazines, etc., you must properly cite the source(s) at the end of your essay. Please use either APA or MLA formatting for all citations; the choice is up to you. A wonderful reference for formatting cited works is [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu).

### Submission

Please email me at [ryan.price@ryerson.ca]({{ site.email }}) with the subject `NPF558-essay`. Attach your 2 images and your essay with the filename `lname-fname.md`. 

Your headshot image must be cropped to 400x400px and saved as an RGB jpg. The filename should be all lowercase and written as `lastname-firstname-headshot.jpg`.

Your main article image must 1500x850px and saved as a jpeg. The filename should be all lowercase and written as `lastname-firstname.jpg`.

_Please, do not ask any questions or provide any other information in this email—all emails with this subject line will be auto-sorted by my computer and I will not be looking at them. If you have any questions please send a separate email with different subject line._
